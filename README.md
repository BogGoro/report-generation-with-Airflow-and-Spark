### Before turning on the DAG, Spark connection should be set:

```
Connection Id: spark-conn
Connection Type: Spark
Host: spark://spark-master
Port: 7077
```

### No need to generate input beforehand, input is automatically generated in DAG to simulate real life situation in wich we need to download new data each day
